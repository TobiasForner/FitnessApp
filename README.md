# Fitness App
This is an Android app to plan and track your workouts. You can also use the app to track your weight.

The initial idea for the app was to circumvent complicated workout setup by using text-only workout descriptions.
Workouts are made out of groups, so that you can repeat sequences of exercises. A workout description has the following format:
```
[Exercise 1, Exercise 2] x 3
[Exercise 3] x 4
```

Feature development is currently paused as I plan to convert the app to Jetpack compose before implementing additional features.
